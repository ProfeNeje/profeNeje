# About Me

I'm a secondary school teacher in Córdoba Capital, passionate about education as a powerful tool that can change lives 💥📚🌍.  
I believe technology is not just something to learn, but a super ally that boosts learning 🚀, sparks creativity 🎨, and activates critical thinking 🧠⚡.

Along my journey, I've had the chance to teach various subjects related to IT and technology: from **Programming IV** 💻 and **Mobile App Development** 📱, to **Workplace Training (FAT)** ⚙️, **Digital Information Systems (SDI)** 🔌, **Software Solutions Development (DSI)** 🖥️, **Computer Applications** 📊, and **Technological Education** 🔧.

In all of them, my goal is for my students to not only learn the theory 🛠️ but also develop skills to face real challenges 🏆, work as a team 🤝, and become active protagonists of their own learning 🌟.

I love supporting my students in creative and practical projects 🎯, combining technology with their daily lives and environment 🌱🌈, so that every learning experience is genuine, motivating, and full of energy 💥🔥.
